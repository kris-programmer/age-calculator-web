# age-calculator-web

An age calculator made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to teach myself to use external JS packages.
The user inputs their birthdate via JavaScript Datepicker and the app calculates and displays their current exact age by using Luxon.

The project will have the following features:

- A form that allows users to input their birthdate using a JavaScript datepicker (replaces the default HTML date picker input)
- Usage of Luxon npm library to calculate the exact age in years, months, and days
- Display the result on the same page after the user submits the form
- Basic validation to ensure the birthdate is valid
- Usage of simple styling to make the calculator visually appealing and responsive
