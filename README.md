# age-calculator-web
An age calculator made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to teach myself in using external packages using npm. 
The user inputs their birthdate via a JavaScript Datepicker and the app calculates and displays their exact age, including years and months, using Luxon.
