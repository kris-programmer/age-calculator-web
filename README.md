# age-calculator-web
An age calculator made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to teach myself to use external JS packages using npm. 
The user inputs their birthdate via a JavaScript Datepicker and the app calculates and displays their exact age, including years and months, using Luxon.

The project will have the following features:
- A form that allows users to input their birthdate using a JavaScript datepicker (avoid the default HTML date picker)
- Usage of Luxon npm library to calculate the exact age in years, months, and days
- Display the result on the same page after the user submits the form
- Basic validation to ensure the birthdate is valid
- Usage of simple styling to make the calculator visually appealing and responsive
